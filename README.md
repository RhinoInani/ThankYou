# Thank You

Is a goal oriented donation tracker that aids you in keeping track of your tax deductible amount.

Every year I believe that everyone should have a set goal for how much they would like to donate. This helps in financial budgeting and gives you a feeling of satisfaction. This is what differentiates Thank You from other donation trackers.

You can find Thank You soon in the App Store and Play Store!

Keep donating and keep coding!
